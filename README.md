# Ashes and Empire
A mod for Victoria 3.

The mod begins in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars (1815), as the great powers of Europe gather at the Congress of Vienna to redraw the continent's political map. The once-mighty French Empire has been defeated, and a new balance of power is emerging, with the United Kingdom, Prussia, Austria, and Russia vying for influence and seeking to expand their spheres of control.

Features:
  * Updated map reflecting the political realities of the post-Napoleonic world.
  * Updated tech tree.
  * Additional journal entries.
  * Reworked diplomatic interests to appropriately constrain expansion.
  * More realistic industrialization.
